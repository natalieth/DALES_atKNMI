Notes about the DALES runs 
ran for 4--14 June with one soil initialisation from the operation ECMWF run 4 June
---> 14 june run was killed, therefore too late to get forcing data from bull 
cold start 16 June soil from ECMWF operational run. (now saving forcing data using a cronjob to WS)

---> june 29 (run 25 june) started a cold start with the right soil types for cabauw rescaled from ecmwf forecasts
